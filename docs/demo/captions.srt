00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
The Dunbar Library & Archive is one of the products 

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,433
of the Dunbar Initiative at the University of Dayton.

3
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:11,799
The public website is the result of a cohort of students and scholars 

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,533
who have gathered and generated collections of resources from all over the world.

5
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:24,066
The DLA contributors and curators interact with images, places, manuscripts, and performances

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:29,599
from the life and times of the Dunbar Family and encode them as Linked Open Data.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,733
Each record included in the DLA has been discovered, described, and enhanced

8
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,966
before a project curator has released it.

9
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:44,232
Some collections are already well organized and described, requiring few annotations.

10
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:49,899
Others may cherry pick records from, for example, a national collection of black authors,

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,800
or add discerning details to generically described library records.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,000
 

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,066
Our correspondence collection is largely comprised of digital images from the University of 

14
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,799
Delaware library.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,533
However, a team of undergraduate students has been adding information and transcriptions.

16
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:16,399
These new annotations draw the UDel records into the DLA and grant them superpowers.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,166
By non-destructively enhancing each record, scholars gain easier discovery, 

18
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:28,132
records can be related to each other and classified, and new documents can be generated 

19
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:34,366
to visualize this intimate record of an American life and relationship in meaningful ways.

20
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:40,099
Users may want to interact with a transcription interface at https://t-pen.org, 

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,700
 

22
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:50,200
Each transcription is a resource itselfavailable to a wide variety of tools for inspection 

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,300
and study.

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,633
It is now possible to inspect the handwriting, cataloger's notes, or material features.

25
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,233
 

26
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:04,799
And it is possible to focus on the text, identifying themes, orthography, and structure.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,000
These projects may be used by future scholars to describe the people and places recorded

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,500
in the letters, or to provide contextual links or essays to the events or concepts mentioned.

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,100
In addition to the accessibility through the Linked Open Data graph, these new contributions to 

30
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,000
Dunbar scholarship are all available in the first of its kind virtual library and archive where 

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,466
scattered collections and new scholarship integrate with a focus on the life of 

32
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:38,466
Paul Laurence Dunbar and his impact on our communities, literature, and world.

33
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:44,232
The letters we've been describing are collected and searchable.

34
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:49,699
Each entry retains its connections, so a student may discover the transcription project, 

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:56,900
the library record at the University of Delware, or explore relationships to other DLA entries.

36
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,100
 

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,500
Different collections may have different connections to explore.

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,400
The Complete Poems are encoded in the DLA and annotated with invaluable resources.

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,866
"A Banjo Song" is a dialect poem that includes a spoken performance to aid understanding.

40
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:24,399
 

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,700
A linked glossary from University of Dayton provides granualar help with challenging terms.

42
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,833
 

43
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:42,766
These helpful resources are linked, of course, and have merely been discovered at the DLA.

44
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:49,032
Some poems have musical settings, available in a linked database of composers.

45
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:55,433
The DLA record brings together several manifestations of the poetry, providing

46
00:03:55,433 --> 00:04:00,499
a useful summary and many paths forward.

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,633
This poem has links out to musical settings, a poem entry at University of Dayton eCommons, 

48
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:10,566
and the TEI-XML encoding of The Complete Poems.

49
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:11,766
 

50
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:16,299
The DLA will continue to grow. Existing entries will be enhanced with new scholarship and 

51
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,700
connections. Project curators are reviewing and accessioning new collections all the time.

52
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,300
The DLA is a place for students to explore, scholars to research, and the public to

53
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,233
discover the significance of Paul Dunbar.
